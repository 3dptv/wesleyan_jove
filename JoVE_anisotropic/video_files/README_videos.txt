This folder contains four video files: one for each camera. The videos are in a custom format (.cpv, meaning "Compressed Video") created by our image compression circuits and cannot be viewed with regular video programs. A MATLAB script that can play the videos is included in this folder. Each is about 5,000 frames, which corresponds to about 11 seconds of the twelve hours of video recorded for each particle type.
