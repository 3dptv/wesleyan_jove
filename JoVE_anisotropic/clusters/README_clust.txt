In this folder are the MATLAB programs that load in video files from the four cameras, identify clusters of bright pixels, and stereomatch them. The video files are .cpv files, which is a custom file format created by our image compression circuits. These programs create outputs that have not been included in this submission. If "find_clusters" is run, it will create these outputs.

There are folders in /output/ called "final_matched" and "final_tracked". These contain the outputs of a script that we are unfortunately not able to include in this publication because it was written by a collaborator. The script takes in the output files of "find_cluster" for each camera and makes these work as a single file with data from all four cameras. This file is then the input of the MATLAB programs that find particle orientations, which are included in this publication.
