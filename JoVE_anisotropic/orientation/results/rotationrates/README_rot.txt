In this folder will be saved the outputs of the code that calculates rotation rates as a function of fit length. These outputs have not been includedbecause the forty files would have made these supplemental files much more cumbersome, but they can be acquired by loading st001_spliced_modelresult.mat into MATLAB, setting this folder as "savepath", and running "calc_rotation". These will also automatically be created by running "find_orientation".
